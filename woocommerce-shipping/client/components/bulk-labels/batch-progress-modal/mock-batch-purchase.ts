/**
 * TEMPORARY: delete when WOOSHIP-2137 service wiring lands.
 *
 * Client-side wiring stub for the batch shipment-create flow.
 *
 * The PHP endpoint at `POST /wcshipping/v1/label/purchase/batch`
 * already exists (see `LabelPurchaseRESTController::purchase_labels_batch`).
 * What this file mocks is the *client-side* wiring: the rate-quote and
 * service-layer plumbing that will eventually feed each shipment into
 * `apiFetch` and stream per-order outcomes into the modal.
 *
 * This stub:
 *   - resolves each order on its own short timer so the progress UI
 *     advances order-by-order instead of flipping the whole batch at
 *     once, and
 *   - returns the same response shape the real endpoint emits, keyed
 *     `order_<id>` and carrying either `{ labels: [...], success: true }`
 *     or `{ error: { code, message } }` entries.
 *
 * Once the service-layer ticket lands, the consumer will swap this for
 * an `apiFetch` POST + `AbortController.signal` plumbing (already
 * threaded through). The on-the-wire `BatchPurchaseResponse` shape
 * stays identical, so the consumer's parser doesn't change.
